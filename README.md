# Operating-Systems
The Operating Systems Study project dives deep into the intricate world of Linux, with a distinct focus on multithreading and file management. It provides an enriching exploration into how operating systems function at both structural and operational levels.

A key component of the project is the study and practical application of multithreaded programming in C. It demonstrates the effective use of synchronization primitives such as mutexes and semaphores for thread safety and efficient scheduling. This understanding of concurrent execution is crucial in today's world of multiprocessor and multicore systems, where proper multithreaded programming can significantly enhance system performance.

Parallel to the thread programming, the project delves into Linux's file management system. It offers a detailed overview of Linux's approach to handling, organizing, and manipulating files, providing insights into efficient file management practices in a Linux environment.

The Operating Systems Study project serves as a comprehensive exploration of key aspects of operating system functionality and multithreaded programming. It underscores the importance of effective thread synchronization and file management, standing as an indispensable resource for anyone keen on mastering these complex yet crucial areas of computing.
